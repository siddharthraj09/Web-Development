# Quiz Manager app

This is a sample application built for my Youtube series on Quiz manager application. The backend API is built using Nest JS - a popular Node JS framework. 

The concept of this app is to allow Users to register themselves and take different Quizes that have been created inside the application. There will be Admins who will be moderating the quizes and also reviewing the responses.
